# 4. Create a program that takes an integer and a string as input, let’s call the integer age and the
# string name. Next your program should print the text: “Hello, my name is <name> and my age is
# <age>.” where <name> and <age> are the values that were input.

name = str(input("Enter your name: "))
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

print("Hello, my name is", name, "and my age is", age)
